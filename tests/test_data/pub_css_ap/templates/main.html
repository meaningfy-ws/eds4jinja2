    <h1>Class instantiation</h1>
    <section>
        <p>The table below describes how are classes instantiated in <strong>{{ conf.title }} </strong>
            dataset. Please note that the instance counts are different
            from total number of unique instances in the data-set. When an individual instantiates multiple classes,
            then it is counted once for each class it instantiates. The relative number of instances is scaled to the
            total number of unique instances per class.</p>

    <h1>Class application profiles</h1>
    <section>
        <p>This section attempts at reconstructing the profiled shapes for each class. The profile is deduced based on
            descriptive statistics presented elsewhere. The tables below contain the following columns: Property name,
            Cardinality, Property Type, Property Range and Confidence.</p>
        <p>
            Confidence is a categorial value derived from the property usage relative to the total number of unique
            individuals instantiating this class.Property range is a list of distinct encountered object types. In case
            of higher number of object type the list is non-exhaustive. Cardinality of the property is expressed in
            terms of minimum and maximum occurrences of the property. The minimum value varies from zero (0) meaning
            that the property is optional to one (1) meaning that the property is mandatory while the maximum value
            varies from one (1) meaning that the property is sufficient to star (*) meaning that the property is
            maximally unbound. Finally the type indicates whether the property range is whether a data type or an
            individual URI.

                in {{ configuration.alpha.title }} and missing from {{ configuration.beta.title }} and finally the

    <h1>Property usage statistics</h1>
    <section>
        <p>This section provides descriptive statistical indicators for each class. The tables below contain the
            following columns: property name, absolute normalised usage (Norm usg/a), absolute actual usage(Usage/a),
            normalised minimum (Min), normalised maximum (Max), normalised average (Avg), relative normalised usage
            (Norm usg/r), relative actual usage (Usage/r).</p>
        <p>The normalization mentioned above refers to counting out of all class individuals how many are actually using
            the property at least once while the actual property usage refers to counting all occurrences for a given
            class. The rdf:type property plays a special role because it indicates the number of unique class instances
            and in case of multiple class instantiation the number is scaled by the number of distinct parent
            classes. </p>
        <p>The relative actual usage (Usage/r) is calculated with respect to a sibling property that maximally occurs in
            all class instances. Therefore there is no standard property to be chosen as reference like in the case of
            rdf:type but it varies from case to case.</p>
